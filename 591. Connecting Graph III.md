# Problem
591. Connecting Graph III

# Problem description
Given n nodes in a graph labeled from 1 to n. There is no edges in the graph at beginning.

You need to support the following method:

connect(a, b), an edge to connect node a and node b
query(), Returns the number of connected component in the graph

**Example**:
```
Input:
ConnectingGraph3(5)
query()
connect(1, 2)
query()
connect(2, 4)
query()
connect(1, 4)
query()

Output:[5,4,3,3]
```

```
Input:
ConnectingGraph3(6)
query()
query()
query()
query()
query()


Output:
[6,6,6,6,6]

```

**Notice**:
```

```
# Tool kits
Union-find

# Thoughts
A follow up of Lintcode 589. For the number of connected components, at the begainning it should be the number of nodes since each node is isolated and thus a connected component. Each time two nodes are connected, the number of compenents will decrease by one, and only by one. 

# Difficulties:


# Code (JAVA)
```java
public class ConnectingGraph3 {
    /**
     * @param a: An integer
     * @param b: An integer
     * @return: nothing
     */
    
    int[] bigBrothers;
    int numComp;
    
    private int find(int x, int f[]) {
        int j, fx;
        
        j = x;
        while (f[j] != j) {
            j = f[j];
        }
        
        while (x != j) {
            fx = f[x];
            f[x] = j;
            x = fx;
        }
        
        return j;
    }
    
    public ConnectingGraph3(int n) {
        // initialize your data structure here.
        numComp = n;
        bigBrothers = new int[n + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            bigBrothers[i] = i;
        }
    }
    
    public void connect(int a, int b) {
        // write your code here
        int fa = find(a, bigBrothers);
        int fb = find(b, bigBrothers);
        
        if (fa != fb) {
            numComp--; // 
        }
        
        bigBrothers[fa] = fb;
    }

    /**
     * @return: An integer
     */
    public int query() {
        // write your code here
        return numComp;
    }
}
```

# Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity**: <br/> connect: O(log *n) ==> O(1) <br/> query: O(1)

**Space Complexity**: <br/> O(n)
