# Problem
1070. Accounts Merge


# Problem description
Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.



**Example**:
```
Example 1:
	Input:
	[
		["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
		["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"],
		["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
		["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]
	]
	
	Output: 
	[
		["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],
		["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"],
		["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]
	]

	Explanation: 
	The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
	The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.

	You could return these lists in any order, for example the answer
	
	[
		['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'],
		['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'],
		['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']
	]
	is also acceptable.
```


**Notice**:
```
The length of accounts will be in the range [1, 1000].
The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10].
The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30].
```
# Tool kits
Union-find

# Thoughts
Union all the emails under the same account, so that all the related emails will be connected. Then find out a way to add account name to each connected email block and add to the results.

# Difficulties:
1. How to fetch the account name for each email block? <br/>
Solution: Use a HashMap to record each email and its account name. So that get the account name of the big brother of one connected block and it will be the account name for the whole block. <br/><br/>
2. How to represent the connected block consist of emails under the same account? <br/>
Solution: Use the first email to represent all the emails. Namely, make the first email the bigBrother of all other emails under the same account.<br/><br/>
3. How to gather all the connected emails under different account? <br/>
Solution: Firstly find the bigBrother for emails under each account, namely the bigBrother of the first email under each account. Use a HashMap to store each bigBrother and a TreeSet of its connected emails. Finally, retrieve emails from this HashMap.<br/><br/>
4. Why to use TreeSet instead of HashSet? <br/>
Solution: Because even though TreeSet take O(Log n) for search, insert or delete, which is higher than HashSet, it keeps sorted data, which is one requirement of this question.

            }
        }
        
        // find the root for email1 under each account and put all the nodes connected to the root to rootToNodes.
        for (List<String> account : accounts) {
            String curtRoot = find(account.get(1)); 
            
            if (!rootToNodes.containsKey(curtRoot)) {

# Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity**: Given the total number of emails as n, the time complexity will be O(nlogn), since except for TreeSet insertion process that will take logn time, all the operations are either O(1) or O(Log*n), which can be deemed as O(1).

**Space Complexity**: O(n)
